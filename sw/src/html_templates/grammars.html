	<h2> Quick intro </h2>

	<div> An <emp> alphabet </emp> is a finite set of symbols. </div>
	<div> A <emp> word </emp> is a finite sequence of symbols from given alphabet. </div>
	<div> A <emp> language </emp> is a set of words. It can be finite or infinite </div>

	<h2> What are formal grammars? </h2>

	<div> Formal grammars are a way to describe languages. Basically, a language L over the alphabet A can be constructed by starting from a symbol S (S is not a member of A) and then applying a series of transformations (called productions), which change S and the subsequent sequences of symbols into different sequences of symbols (it is just like the find-replace functionality available in most text editors). The process stops once we reach a sequence of symbols which is a member of L. Applying different transformations can produce every word of L. </div>

	<h2> Formal definition of a formal grammar </h2>

	<div> A formal grammar is an ordered quadruple (it has 4 elements and we know which is which)</div>
	<div class="math"> G = (T, N, S, P), T ∩ N = ∅, S ∈ N </div>
	<div> where
	<ul>
		<li> T is the set of terminals (symbols that make up the target alphabet). </li>
		<li> N is the set of nonterminals (symbols that do not appear in the final word, but are present during its creation). </li>
		<li> S is the head of the grammar (the nonterminal that starts all word generation). </li>
		<li> P is the set of productions. Productions have the form of LHS -&gt; RHS, where LHS is a sequence of nonterminals and RHS is a sequence of nonterminals and terminals. </li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div> A grammar is said to be <emp> context free </emp> if (and only if) every production contains a single nonterminal as its LHS. </div>
	
	<h2> The Backus-Naur Form </h2>
	<div> The Backus-Naur From is a standardized way to write the production rules. All nonterminals are wrapped in diamond braces. LHS and RHS of a production are separated by ::= . The alternative operator, | , introduces an alternative RHS to the given LHS. </div>
